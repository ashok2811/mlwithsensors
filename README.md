# ML with Sensors
In this repo, I will teach you how to get started Machine Learning with your own sensors. Here we are sending data from a sensors to a server wirelessly. The server is processing the data and extrating meaning out of that data using Machine Learning.
####  Step 0 >> Componets you will need.  
Arduino *(here Arduino Nano)* , A Sensor *(here MPU6050)* , ESP8266-01
####  Step 1 >> Making your ESP ready to send the data.  

####  Step 2 >> Making your sensor ready.  

####  Step 3 >> Send data to UDP Server.  

####  Step 4 >> Save the incoming data. *(server side)*  

####  Step 5 >> View Data.  

####  Step 6 >> Filtering and Trimming the Data.  

####  Step 7 >> Feature Extraction and Labelling.  

####  Step 8 >> Training your Classifier and exporting the Model.  

####  Step 9 >> Realtime Predictions.
