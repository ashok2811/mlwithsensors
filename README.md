# ML with Sensors
In this repo, I will teach you how to get started Machine Learning with your own sensors. Here we are sending the data from the sensors to the server wirelessly. The server is processing the data and extrating meaning out of that data using Machine Learning.
####  Step 0 >> Componets you will need.  
Arduino *(here Arduino Nano)* , A Sensor *(here MPU6050)* , ESP8266-01
####  Step 1 >> Making your ESP ready to send the data.  
We will use **UDP protocol** to send and recieve data.
####  Step 2 >> Making your sensor ready.  
We will use **UDP protocol** to send and recieve data.
####  Step 3 >> Send data to UDP Server.  
We will use **UDP protocol** to send and recieve data.
####  Step 1 >> Save the incoming data. *(server side)*  
We will use **UDP protocol** to send and recieve data.
