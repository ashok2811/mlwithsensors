# ML with Sensors
In this repo, I will teach you how to get started Machine Learning with your own sensors. Here we are sending the data from the sensors to the server wirelessly. The server is processing the data and extrating meaning out of that data using Machine Learning.
####  Step 0 >> Componets you will need.  
Arduino *(here Arduino Nano)* , A Sensor *(here MPU6050)* , ESP8266-01
####  Step 1 >> Making your ESP ready to send the data.  

####  Step 2 >> Making your sensor ready.  

####  Step 3 >> Send data to UDP Server.  

####  Step 4 >> Save the incoming data. *(server side)*  

####  Step 5 >> View Data.  

####  Step 6 >> Filtering and Trimming the Data.  

####  Step 7 >> Feature Extraction and Labelling.  

####  Step 8 >> Training you Classifier and exporting the Model.  

####  Step 9 >> Realtime Predictions.
